## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Weather API key (from Tomorrow.io)
- Geocoding API key (from Maps.co)

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-agent.git
cd weather-agent
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

## How It Works

1. User enters a weather-related question
2. The agent processes the query using OpenAI's GPT-4 model
3. The agent uses the geocoding API to determine the location's coordinates
4. The agent retrieves weather data from the weather API
5. The result is displayed in a conversational format
