## Quick Start

To create a documentation with MkDocs, these are the main bash commands:

* Install mkdocs: `pip install mkdocs`
* Create a new documentation folder: `mkdocs new .`
* `mkdocs.yml` is the file to customize the web page, such as creating tabs, changing titles and themes.
* The files in the folder **docs** are the ones to hold the documentation text, using MarkDown notation.
